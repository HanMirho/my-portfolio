       <h2>Tl;dr</h2>
<p><b>--</b> Was brought on to Digikala.com as a solo Senior UX Writer. 
<br><br><b>--</b> Was tasked to build up a comprehensive content design strategy, codify the neglected tone and voice, and integrate UX Writing workflow into the Design workflow.
<br><br><b>--</b> Planned the research, created the strategy, made all the diagrams, flowcharts, and presentations that corporate <i>looooves</i>. Did a bunch of negotiating, horse-trading, and compromising to get stakeholder buy-in.
<br><br><b>--</b> Company went through a merger, directions changed and layoffs ensued before any comprehensive change. :(
</p>
<br>

<h2>1. Getting a feel for the status quo</h2>

<p>The onboarding process was quick and snappy. That was mainly because there wasn't much to be onboarded on. <br>
Digikala, with more than a 1000 tech and product employees, had:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No unifying framework or workflow for UX Writing.</li>
  <li>No codified tone of voice guidelines (and the little that existed was ignored by the product department).</li>
  <li>No support for the role of UX writers: writers were treated as “copy polishers” rather than partners in shaping IA, or mental models.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>But these were the challenges I was brought on to handle. So I got on to it.</p>
<br>
<h2>2. What I did</h2>
<p>
I proposed and carried out how UX Writing fit into product development:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>New workflow & structure:</b> UX Writers would join projects at the same stage as product designers, ensuring content shaped the user experience from the start.</li>
  <div class="img-container">
<img src="src/images/fail-diagram.jpg" alt="diagrams">
</div>
<li><b>Horse-trading:</b> Negotiated with PMs, design leads, and junior execs to secure enough buy-in to pitch directly to the Chief Product Officer.</li>
<li><b>AI for content inventory:</b> We had no source of truth, designs almost never matched production, and there was a heap of UGC to sort through. With the tech team busy, we wrote a crawler using ChatGPT that would give me a database of all content we had written, along with their urls.</li>
<li><b>Team structure:</b> Advocated for increasing the 'team' headcount from 1 to 3 UX Writers, so that every two squads shared at least one dedicated writer.</li>
 <div class="img-container">
<img src="src/images/Team Structure.jpg" alt="diagrams">
</div>
  <li><b>Discover ToV perception using UXR:</b> Launched a joint research project to serve as the foundations of a research-validated tone of voice guideline, making content more consistent and user-centered. (This has <a href="casestudy_tovResearch.html">its own case study!)</a></li>
  <li><b>Social listening for mental models:</b> We also needed to see what verbs and adjectives people were using to refer to describe the action of using a number of our new and old features. With the help of a kindred soul in the data team, we started a side-project to set up a listener for certain features and words on social media.</li>
</ul><br>
<h2>3. How it fell apart</h2>
<p>
Right when momentum was building, the business strategy shifted dramatically:
<ul>
  <li>Digikala was secretly preparing to sell to the Hamrah-e-Avval holding group.</li>
  <li>Leadership changes and cost-cutting measures deprioritized UX and content.</li>
  <li>The changing of the guard dampened momentum, and my proposals never reached full implementation.</li>
  <li>Soon after, layoffs hit—affecting UX Writers, designers, researchers, and PMs. I was among those let go.</li>
</ul></p><br>
<h2>4.Little wins; and other take aways</h2>
<p>
This case study isn't a march of triumph, as most others are. But there are people and projects that I still remember fondly.
I also learned a couple of lessons:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Diagnoses can be easy. But implementing change depends on timing, politics, leadership buy-in, and sometimes, even the damned weather.</p></li>
  <li><p>UX Writing needs structural support. Climbing the UX maturity pyramid without organizational support for proper headcount, workflow, and cultural understanding, is almost impossible. Without it, the role will be marginalized.</p></li>
  <li><p>Change is brittle. Business priorities can shift overnight, and even well-designed strategies can collapse if they don't change with the C-suite's agenda.</p></li>
  
</ul>
