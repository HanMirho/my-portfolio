      <h2>Some context</h2>
       
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="casestudy_failure.html">the other case study</a>, when I joined Digikala (biggest e-commerce in Iran and MENA, basically Amazon for Iran), one of the biggest gaps
I noticed was the absence of a real guideline for content design and our voice. What existed was a loose set of instructions and traditions that were mostly ignored by product teams. </p>
<p>At the same time, Digikala was facing challenges in public opinion. Our NPS scores were declining, and I suspected that the way I wrote to users did not align with our values or brand identity.
To confirm this, I proposed a research project in collaboration with the UX Research team.</p><br>
<h2>1.Objectives</h2>
<p>
I wanted to answer three main questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>What tone of voice do users currently perceive from Digikala's product?</b></li>
<li><b>Does this match our intended brand voice and values?</b></li>
<li><b>How can we use these insights as a baseline for revamping our UX writing guidelines?</b></li></ul>
<p>My belief was that defining or rewriting guidelines would be meaningless unless we could also prove that users perceived them as intended. <br>I chose NNG's <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tone-of-voice-dimensions/">4-dimensional model</a> as our framework for measuring our ToV & its effects.
I then designed a survey that would ask users to score Digikala on each axis. This would give us a quantifiable snapshot of how our voice was being received.</p>
<br>
<h2>2.Challenges & experiment design</h2>
<p>
The main challenge here was designing the research with the right inclusion and exclusion criteria. I considered two approaches:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Pair each question with excerpts of existing UX copy from the product.</b></li>
  <ul><li>Pros: Focuses users on UX copy specifically and prevents them from thinking about unrelated texts from marketing, SMS, or ads.</li>
  <li>Cons: Forces users to rate texts in isolation, outside the context of their real relationship with the brand.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Ask users to score us based on their overall experience with Digikala.</b></li>
  <ul><li>Pros: Keeps the context intact and reflects how users actually perceive the brand, in addition to excluding the UGC on the platform.</li>
  <li>Cons: Includes influence from non-UX writing channels, making it harder to isolate UX copy's impact</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>I chose to go with both approaches, starting with an overall assessment, because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It kept the user in the context of their full brand experience.</li>
  <li>It would target UX copy and give us an assessment of its situation, along with writing from other departments.</li>
  <li>Because of the previous point, the results would be useful beyond the product team, benefiting marketing, CX, and support as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a couple of sample survey questions that I ended up preparing:</p>

</div>
<div class="in-txt-img">
  <img src="src/images/tovResearchEx2.png" alt="diagrams">
</div>
<p>The same questions would be asked for each axis, for notifications, text messages, and snippets of writing from the app.</p> <br>

<h2>3.Aaaaand we got laid-off.</h2>
<p>
Unfortunately, the project never made it past the planning stage. Digikala entered a merger process, and soon after, both the UX Research and UX Writing teams were hit by layoffs.</p>

<p>Still, I believe the project was novel and promising. Using the survey to score our tone, we could have set a strong, data-backed, foundation for fresh and enforceable guidelines. It also could have fostered more cooperation across departments, which Digikala sorely lacked.</p>
